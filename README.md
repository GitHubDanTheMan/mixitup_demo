# mixitup_demo
I am having a frustrating issue with MixItUp 3. This demo, which is based on the 'checkbox' demo found on the
MixItUp website, shows the problem I am having. The display of the image grid comes from another demo I found on CodePen.

The filtering and sorting work perfectly well. However, I want each image to link to an HTML page (in the pages folder).
This also works perfectly with the filtering. But! If you do a sort by clicking on the sort button, the links no longer work.
After a sort, every image then links to the first HTML page. Reload the page and everything works fine again.
Click on sort and the links are broken again.

I would be very grateful for any help in solving this problem.

Thanks,

Daniel.
