# mixitup_demo
I am having a frustrating issue with MixItUp 3. This demo, which is based on the 'checkbox' demo found on the MixItUp website, shows the problem I am having. The display of the image grid comes from another demo I found on CodePen.

The filtering and sorting work perfectly well. However, I want each image to link to an HTML page (in the pages folder). This also works perfectly with the filtering. But! If you do a sort by clicking on the sort button, the links no longer work. After a sort, every image then links to the first HTML page. Reload the page and everything works fine again. Click on sort and the links are broken again.

Is there anyone here who might know what is going on and how I might fix it? I am very inexperienced with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I would be grateful for any help.

Thank you.

Daniel.
